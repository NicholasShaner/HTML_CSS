		<p id="backgroud-story" class="body" style="padding: 10 5 10 5 text-align: left"> My name is Nick. I current live outside Winston-Salem, North Carolina 
			with my amazing wife Stephanie, and two incredible daughters, five year old
			Nora, and 2 year old Elsie. For the last 16 years since leaving highschool,
			I have worked as an automotive technician, the last 5 years of which I 
			have primarily worked on heavy-duty and diesel vehicles. Though I do 
			thoroughly enjoy being a mechanic, I came to the realization that this is 
			not a career that I feel will keep me mentally, physically, and financially 
			fulfilled. Since a very young age, I have always had a desire to learn more 
			about computers and software. I have finally decided that now is the time to 
			take charge and make a change for myself and my family. As of January 2, 
			2023 I have been working towards my associates degree in IT. I am looking to 
			use the program to get an introduction to various different fields within IT 
			and make a decision to which field I would like to concentrate on for my 
			bachelors program. As of right now, once I complete my associates program 
			next spring, I am planning to immediately transfer into the computer science 
			program with a concentration in software development.
